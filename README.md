# Requests Lab: Countries of the World

**Lab Duration: 150 minutes**

### Learning Objectives

- Be able to make an `XMLHttpRequest` to receive data
- Be able to navigate JSON data structures
- Be able to integrate an API request into the pub/sub pattern

## Brief

Your task is to create an app that allows users to select a country from a drop-down to see information about it.

Use the start point provided and use the [Rest Countries API](https://restcountries.eu/) as your data source.

### MVP

- Create a select populated with the name of the countries.
- When a user selects a country from the drop-down, display the country's:
  - name
  - region
  - flag

### Extensions

- In addition to displaying the country's name, region and flag, display a list of the country's languages.

### Considerations

What are the responsibilities of the models and views? What is going to be responsible for making the `XMLHttpRequest` request?

### Planning

Draw a diagram of your files, detailing:

- the publishing of and subscribing to events.
- the flow of data through the application.

One approach you could take would be to:

1. Start by making the request to the API from the model.
2. Once you have checked you can load the API data into your application, store the data as a property on the model (so you can access it later) and publish it out the application.
3. Implement the view that needs the data: `SelectView` subscribes to the data being published and uses it to populate the select.
4. Once your select is populated with the country names, the next event that needs handling is the `change` event on the select, which is triggered by user interaction. Add an event listener to the select's `change` event, that publishes the index of the selected country out to the application.
5. The model then subscribes to the channel to receive the published index, finds the corresponding country object, and publishes it out the application.
6. A second view receives the selected country object and displays it's details to the page.
